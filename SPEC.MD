JavaScript
[X] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
I have a user class that has static methods, and multiple functions that can be referenced repeatedly as needed.

[X] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
ES6 syntax is used, such as arrow function syntax, along with a constructor function in my user class.

[X] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).
I employ arrow functions, and let & const in my app.

Rails
[X] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
Users are handled by a user controller, and expenses are handled by an expenses controller. The URLs are also RESTful.

[X] Well-named variables and methods
Methods are conventionally named index, show, delete, create, etc.

[X] Short, single-purpose methods
Methods are succint and RESTful.

Git
[X] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
I committed frequently with meaningful messages.

[X] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
I committed frequently with meaningful messages.

[X] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
I committed frequently with meaningful and accurate messages.
